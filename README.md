# range

`[a, b]` represents the range of numbers between `a` and `b` (included). `]a, b[` represents the same range, but `a` and `b` excluded.

Your task is to write two functions:

- The first one should tell whether a range contains another: `[0, 2]` contains `[0, 1]` but `[0, 2]` does not contain `[3, 3.5]`

- The second one should compute the intersection of two ranges: the intersection of `[0, 2]` and `[1, 5]` is `[1, 2]`
